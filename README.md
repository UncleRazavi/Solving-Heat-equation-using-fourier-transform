# Heat Equation Solver using FFT and ODEINT

## Overview

This project implements a numerical solution to the heat equation using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the `odeint` method from the SciPy library. The heat equation is a fundamental partial differential equation that describes how heat diffuses through a given region over time. This implementation provides an efficient way to simulate and visualize the heat distribution over time.

## Features

- **Numerical Solution**: Solves the heat equation using an efficient combination of FFT and `odeint`.
- **Visualization**: Plots the heat distribution at various time steps.
- **Flexible Parameters**: Allows customization of the initial conditions, domain size, and simulation duration.
